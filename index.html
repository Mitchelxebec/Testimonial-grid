                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were currently, if not more so, in the
                company i joined. I honestly feel i got&nbsp;every penny's worth.

                have heard some people who amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it
                incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and gruelling-time of my
                life. Since completing the course i've successfully switched careers, working as a
                Software&nbsp;Engineer at VR startup."

                "Before joining the bootcamp, i've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged enroll by a former
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
                did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level that no tutorial could
                ever have. In fact, i've referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It
                certainly help me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
